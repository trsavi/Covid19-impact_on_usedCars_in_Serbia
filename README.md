### Data source: [polovniautomobili.com](http://polovniautomobili.com)

#### Data parameters:
 - Marka - Brand of the car
 - Model - Model of the car
 - Godiste - Year of production
 - Kilometraza - Mileage
 - Karoserija - Car type
 - Gorivo - Fuel type
 - Kubikaza - Engine volume
 - Snaga - Engine power (BHS)
 - Cena - Car price in euros
 - Godina - Year of getting the data

Parameter "Godina" shows when the data was scraped from site polovniautomobili.com 

With this analysis I'm trying to understand the impact that COVID-19 had on used cars market in Serbia through examining the same (almost the same) dataset but just two years apart, from 2019. and one from 2021. The web-craping technique was the same in both cases - scrape first two pages of car ads (with specifications) for each model and save it to csv file, more on this here: [webScraper](https://github.com/trsavi/Polovni-Automobili-Webscraper)
